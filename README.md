Hello there! I'm an awesome plugin that allows you to easily publish, monetize, and manage your content for Google AMP and Facebook Instant Articles directly from WordPress, with support for Google Analytics. You can access your AMP articles by adding /amp at the end of any article URL. You can also access your Instant Articles RSS feed by adding /feed/instant to your site URL.

---------------

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Configure via the WPDev Mobile options page in the dashboard.
